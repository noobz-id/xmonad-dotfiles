In case: I use Arch BTW ðŸ¤­
and also work for all linux distro with xmonad installed.

Needed :
1.  xorg -> display server
2.  xmonad -> yeah you must install this
3.  xmonad-contrib -> more libs for xmonad
4.  xmonad-utils -> xmonad utilities
5.  xmobar -> panel / status bar

Attributes (used for this config):
1.  trayer -> system tray
2.  brightnessctl -> control monitor brightness
3.  pactl -> audio volume control
4.  pulseaudio -> audio server
5.  nm-applet -> Network manager applet.
6.  blueman-applet -> bluetooth manager applet.
7.  pasystray -> pulseaudio system tray
8.  nitrogen -> wallpaper manager
9.  udiskie -> usb auto mounter with system tray support
10. alacritty -> my favorite terminal
11. Ubuntu font, Awesome font, Mononoki font, google-font(optional) -> font collection
12. rofi -> replacement for dmenu. what ?, this is app launcher menu. to change theme, execute command: "rofi-theme-selector" > enter selected theme (preview) > "Alt + a" to apply or "Esc" to cancel.
13. scrot -> screenshot program
14. lxsession -> i have benefit features from this program like: polkit (gvfs: android-mtp, apple-mobile-device, volume mounter and more), auto start support xdg desktop files (/etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart) many application use this like virtualbox daemon, etc. i customize the auto start program like nitrogen,trayer and udiskie to ~/.config/autostart. so you no need to edit and recompile again the xmonad.hs. you can add more autostart (.desktop) program to this folder if you needed and enable/disable in Desktop Session Settings

NOTE:
1. Xmonad Config and stuff in: ~/.xmonad, Xmobar config: ~/.xmonad/xmobar/xmobar.hs
2. This config set Menu key as Super_R key, because in my keyboard layout only have Left Super key (Super_L). i don't need the Menu key, so i remap this key. See xmonad.hs at line #84: spawnOnce "xmodmap -e \"keysym Menu = Super_R\"" , you can delete this line if you not used my key map.
3. Please change /home/zuliz to /home/your_user directory in xmobar.hs at lines #18 & #21, or xmobar will broken.
4. if you just follow my config please install required Attributes software above.
5. all changed in xmonad.hs mustbe recompiled, use cmd: xmonad --recompile. then restart your xmonad or re-login.


CHANGE ANYTHING IF YOU WANT, USE YOUR FAVORITE SEARCH ENGINE FOR REFERENCES. ANY SETUP IN THIS CONFIG WORK WELL IN MY HARDWARE, IF YOU JUST FIND PROBLEM FOR YOUR DEVICE YOU CAN READ DOCUMENTATION FOR XMONAD,XMOBAR,WIKI,ETC... DO IT YOUR OWN RISK...
